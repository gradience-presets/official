# Official list
List of all official preset (fetched by Gradience)

The list is a simple text file with one preset per line which can be found at `official` in this repo.

## New preset process

Presets can be moved from the `community` repo to the `official` repo. That's the process:

1. The preset should already be in the `community` repo. If not, refer to this repo for submiting.
2. Open an issue and select the `New preset` template.
3. After opening the preset, the preset will be in review. For being accepted, the preset must be voted by at least 50% of the team.
